# Short Puzzle Maker - Engine Configuration

This document outlines the operational rules for the automated production engine.

## Full Bundle Generation Logic (Optimized for Shorts):
The "Auto-Pilot" mode now triggers a strategic sequence of 10 videos designed for channel growth.

1. **Phase 1: Hooks (3 Videos)**
   - Duration: 15s - 30s
   - Complexity: 400 - 800 Pieces
   - Purpose: Maximize Watch Time % with fast reveals.

2. **Phase 2: Narratives (4 Videos)**
   - Duration: 30s - 50s
   - Complexity: 800 - 1500 Pieces
   - Purpose: Visual storytelling with rhythmic assembly.

3. **Phase 3: High-Engagement (3 Videos)**
   - Duration: 55s - 60s
   - Complexity: 1500 - 2500 Pieces
   - Purpose: Retention testing with high-detail historical reconstructions.

## Visual & Physics Policy:
- **Aspect Ratio:** Strictly Fixed 1080x1920 (Shorts).
- **Format Policy:** All non-vertical logic (Landscape/Story Grid) has been purged to ensure 100% compatibility with mobile-first discovery.
- **Starry Trail FX:** Particles are generated at the lead edge of assembly nodes to create kinetic energy.
- **Engagement CTA:** Like & Subscribe GIF rendered at -10s before finish.

## Audio Policy:
- **Background Music:** Fetched from local track pool or cloud hub.
- **Snap SFX:** Procedurally generated or custom uploaded clicks recorded directly into the output stream.
